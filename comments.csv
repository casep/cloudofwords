Jeffrey,If we always do what we have always done we will always get the same results. We must embrace change to thrive and survive
Jeffrey,"In 2019 15 gentleman attended an Area White Table, resulting in 5 candidates joining our organisation."
Paul,"New members should meet with other lodges new members to discuss there experiences and to show that they are not the only new members, what has worked for them and pass this on. A special lodge meeting in a particular area could be arranged followed by a dinner."
Keith,Social event well advertised to all in community as well as Masons.

Neil ,To make sure you have Fun! If you make it enjoyable others will want to join you!
Antony ,"a return to core activities, lectures etc. many join a lodge especially to experience and be part of this"
Richard ,We need to meet more on a social front especially including Partners and this is where interested new members can meet the membership. I think this is more important where the lodge only meets on a few occasions
Mike ,"In the past Freemasonry has been veiled in secrecy and has been difficult to get information on. We are hoping to put an event on in Birkenhead Park run by Cheshire 1 next year for the general public, which hopefully will lift some of the mysteries of freemasonry for the public at large and to give the public information on the good work freemasons do and to put freemasonry more into the public domain"
Hakim ,"Public lecture events on the traditions of Freemasonry and its place in world history amongst other subject (only in Freemason Hall to not be ""pushy""). Best idea: be a shinny example in Life than make other want to emulate and when they ask Freemasonry is part of the answer"
David ,Social events with partners and family I think would be a great idea. I am in a motorcycle chapter and they encourage family and friends involvement in social activities and it works well
Mathew ,would a good start be to contact members who have left in a area and ask them if they would consider coming back  as if they have had a exit interview we should have the reasons to get them back
Garry ,Not a question but a statement - The Almoner of our Lodge will always contact any member who has not given his apologies at a meeting and the secretary will only record those who have formally given their apologies

Chris ,"Survey your members. Try to identify a common theme if there is one, be it a profession or hobby etc, and use that as a tool to try to find like-minded potential candidates."
Paul ,"organise social events, such as curry nights, and let prospective candidates meet others in the Lodge. it also helps new members get to know the rest of the membership outside of a Lodge setting"
Richard ,"Back to basics, talk about it with lodge members, enthuse members to pro-actively talk to their network of people. Encourage care teams to keep existing members enjoying their Freemasonry."
Kered ,Members to think of 3 people
Gareth ,"Organising an event - bring two ‘friends’ to an open social event, with a talk and discussion (a meal is always good!) about what FM is, and what it can mean to prospective members, along with a signpost for how they can understand more and hopefully join."
Kered,Have FUN
Simon ,The Rochdale District take over Morrisons Supermarket on the week building up to Remembrance Day selling Poppies. We are easily identifiable as Masons and have literature promoting Freemasonry. We are able to talk to people buying Poppies about Freemasonry which firstly promotes the Craft in a good light but also allows us to talk to a wide range of the public about what we do
Doug,Create small teams within each lodge say 5 to 6  and undertake the same exercise you have done...this will also create competition.
Ibrahim ,"All the effort are tactical efforts, the lodges need a strategic intervention from provence by amalgamating most of the small lodges into a large one - size matters.  "
Michael,define each lodges “USP” and build from there
David ,"Have refreshments on arrival, , then the Lodge meeting, followed by toasts.  Some brethren find eating late not conducive to their health. Also it would benefit brethren who are working will have an better opportunity to attend without affecting their work."
Steven ,"Most Lodges I visit in West Yorkshire meet 7 to 7.30, which is useful"
Kered ,"Lodge Almoner suggested to Brethren to call different members who wouldn't normally see outside of lodge regularly, this has been a great success and all feel connected and all know each other better"
Steven,"As new mason, I do not hide this fact from anyone. hopefully this will continue with newer members. although their is still some stigma attached sadly over miss understandings "
